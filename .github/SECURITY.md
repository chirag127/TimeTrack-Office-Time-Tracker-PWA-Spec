# Security Policy

At **OfficeTimeTracker-Progressive-Web-App-Specification**, we are committed to ensuring the security and integrity of our project. We deeply appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the open-source community in helping us maintain a secure environment.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover any security-related issues within this project, please report them to us immediately. Please **DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

To report a vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1.  **Email Us:** Send a detailed report to `security@chirag127.dev` (or a similar dedicated security email address). If a specific security email isn't available, use `chirag127.dev@gmail.com`.
2.  **Provide Details:** In your email, include the following information:
    *   A clear and concise description of the vulnerability.
    *   Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   Any potential impact or exploit scenarios.
    *   Suggested mitigation or fixes (if any).
    *   Your contact information for follow-up.
3.  **Encryption (Optional but Recommended):** If you wish to encrypt your report, please request a PGP key in your initial email. We will provide it for secure communication.

We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within **48 hours** and provide an estimated timeline for resolution. We commit to keeping you informed about the progress of the reported vulnerability.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We kindly request that you adhere to the following principles of responsible disclosure:

*   **Private Communication:** Report vulnerabilities directly to us via the designated email address before making them public.
*   **Good Faith:** Act in good faith to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, or interruption of our services.
*   **Timeliness:** Allow us a reasonable amount of time (typically 30-90 days, depending on severity and complexity) to address the vulnerability before public disclosure.

## Our Commitment

*   We will promptly investigate all legitimate reports.
*   We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the vulnerability resolution process.
*   We will credit you publicly for your responsible disclosure (with your permission) once the vulnerability has been patched and released.
*   We will prioritize the security of our users and the integrity of the **OfficeTimeTracker-Progressive-Web-App-Specification** project.

Thank you for helping us build a more secure project.
